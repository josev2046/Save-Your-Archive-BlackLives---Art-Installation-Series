# Save Your Archive: BlackLives - Art Installation Series

This repository details the "Save Your Archive: BlackLives" art installation series, a collection of exhibits designed to honour, preserve, and present pivotal Black voices and narratives. Each installation offers an intimate auditory experience, bridging historical archives with contemporary engagement.

## Example Installation: The Fela Kuti Tapes

This specific installation exemplifies the series' approach:

* **Visual Centrepiece**: A quarter-inch open-reel tape is mounted prominently within a clean, elegant frame. This serves as a symbolic focal point, representing the analogue origins of recorded sound.
* **Hidden Audio**: Discreetly positioned behind the frame, a digital media player provides a continuous sound loop. This setup ensures that the visual simplicity of the reel is maintained whilst delivering the auditory content.
* **Immersive Listening**: A pair of headphones, connected to the hidden player, beckons the viewer to lean in and absorb the powerful narrative.
* **Content Focus**: The sound loop features a radio interview with the legendary Fela Kuti from 1992. This direct connection to a key figure provides an immersive historical experience.

## Technical Simplicity

The installation prioritises a straightforward technical setup for ease of deployment and maintenance:

* **In-frame Element**: The open-reel tape itself is purely a visual element; it is an old archive reel, not connected to any playback mechanism within the frame.
* **Digital Playback**: All audio playback is managed independently by the hidden digital media player, ensuring reliability and consistent sound quality. The headphones are cabled directly to the hidden media player, offering a dedicated and personal listening experience.

## Project Ethos

"Save Your Archive: BlackLives" is more than just an art object; it is a portal. It highlights the rich tapestry of the Blacklondon Radio Project (see [https://github.com/josev2046/SYA-BlackLives-The-GLR-Black-London-Collection](https://github.com/josev2046/SYA-BlackLives-The-GLR-Black-London-Collection) for more details). Through these installations, we aim to encourage reflection on history, activism, and the ongoing journey for liberation, bringing these vital recordings to a wider audience in an accessible and engaging format.

## Future Installations

This Fela Kuti piece is the first in a planned series. We intend to develop further installations focusing on other significant figures and moments from the Black British and broader Black diaspora experience.
