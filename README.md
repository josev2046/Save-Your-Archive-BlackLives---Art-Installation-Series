"Save Your Archive: BlackLives" is a proposed art installation series dedicated to honouring, preserving, and activating pivotal archival recordings of Black voices and histories. Conceived as an immersive and modular exhibition, the project bridges traditional archival practice and analogue audio heritage with contemporary digital technologies, offering audiences intimate engagements with voices from the Black British and wider African and Caribbean diasporic experience.

Each installation will be framed thematically and situated within broader historical and cultural contexts—curated to invite reflection on social justice, cultural memory, political resistance, and artistic expression. The series aims to evolve over time, functioning as both a growing repository and a travelling exhibition platform.

## Curatorial Framework

"Save Your Archive: BlackLives" is rooted in the ethos of historical care, creative reclamation, and public access. Drawing from collections such as Black London, these installations are intended to function not merely as aesthetic experiences but as pedagogical and political interventions. They foreground overlooked or suppressed voices, activating them in public spaces and inviting new modes of listening, understanding, and remembrance.

Rather than a standalone display, the series is envisioned as a structured sequence of interconnected installations. Each will focus on thematically linked subjects—e.g., diasporic resistance, Black cultural production, anti-racist broadcasting—and may include multiple pieces per theme. This approach facilitates more complex storytelling and offers opportunities to explore layered narratives through sound, artefacts, and visual documentation.

## Exhibition Design Concept

This prototype installation exemplifies the series’ format and curatorial strategy:

* **Title:** The Fela Kuti Tapes, "Unframed Voices"
* **Visual Centrepiece**: A quarter-inch analogue open-reel archive tape or a photograph is prominently mounted within a minimalist frame, serving as both a visual artefact and conceptual entry point.
* **Hidden Audio**: Embedded behind the visual display, a concealed digital media player plays a curated loop—e.g., a rare 1992 radio interview with Fela Kuti. 
* **Immersive Listening**: High-quality headphones, discreetly connected to the player, invite individual listeners to physically lean in and engage deeply with the content (Figure 1); alternatively, a directional audio speaker or array (Figure 2), which projects the sound into the defined listening zone, offers a shared and immersive auditory experience for those within the designated area.

## Venues & Partnerships

Installations are designed to be flexible for display in a range of venues—galleries, libraries, universities, and community spaces. A provisional list of target venues and confirmed expressions of interest can be provided upon request.

We are currently identifying partners in:

* Archival and memory institutions
* Cultural foundations
* Broadcasting and audio heritage networks
* Black British history researchers and community organisations



## Budget & Timeline

A detailed budget is in development and includes artist/curator fees, technical production costs, transport and installation logistics, rights clearance (where applicable), and marketing/outreach.

An initial development timeline envisions:

* Prototype completion: Q4 2025
* First exhibition launch: Q2 2026
* Touring series rollout: Q3 2026 onwards


## Next Steps

The Fela Kuti installation is the first in a planned series, with future pieces in development focusing on key figures and moments in Black British and diasporic media history. We are actively seeking funding, collaborators, and exhibition partners to realise this ambitious and vital project.
